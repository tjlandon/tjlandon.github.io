I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Maryland. My research lies at the intersection of public and labor economics and focuses on understanding the influence of economic conditions and policy decisions on individual decision-making, particularly among marginalized groups. The core areas of my work encompass crime, marriage, and education.
